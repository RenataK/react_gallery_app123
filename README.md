# react_gallery_app123

In this project, you'll find the use of a very popular and in-demand React library to create an image gallery app. With the help of this powerful "MVC" (Model, View, Controller) library, the app is built in the style of modern single-page applications to keep it fast, modular, and in sync with current web development trends.

Best practices of working with React: 
 using JSX to write markup-like syntax directly in JS files  
 managing state in a container component that passes data down to reusable stateless components.
 Working with React supportive tools like the Create React App and React Router modules.

Using the powerful Create React App tool:

Use JavaScript and JSX to build out the gallery components in a modular fashion.
Use React Router to set up routes for three default topic pages and a search page.
Use the Fetch API or a tool like Axios to fetch data from the Flickr API and use it to display images in your app.
Add logic to handle the search and various requirements of the project.
Add to the supplied CSS to personalize the project.
